I am Patrick Tulskie.  I wasn't given this name by choice, but I don't really have any plans to change it.  It's really grown on me.

I'm a software engineer based out of New York.  I work in New York City but I would never live there.  I much prefer it in the burbs where there are trees and open space.

Currently I work at BeenVerified.  I started with the company in September 2008 back when there were only a few of us sharing a small room in an office in Mid Town Manhattan.  One pivot, several product iterations, and more mistakes than I can count later, I'm still there.  I love what I do and the team that I've helped to grow and I wouldn't trade it for the world.

When I'm not hacking on software and optimizing for performance, you can find me at the race track or wrenching on my car in the garage.
