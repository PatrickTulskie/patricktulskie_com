I am Patrick Tulskie.  I wasn't given this name by choice, but I don't really have any plans to change it.  It's really grown on me.

I'm a software engineer based out of New York.  I used to work in New York City but these days I work remote. My whole team is remote so there isn't much point in going into an office every day.

Currently I work at [The Lifetime Value Co.](https://www.ltvco.com)  I started with the company in September 2008 back when it was just called BeenVerified and there were only a few of us sharing a small room in an office in Mid Town Manhattan. I don't even think I knew how to code back then. One pivot, several product iterations, and more mistakes than I can count later, I'm still there.  Started as a junior programmer, had no title for the better part of a decade, and now I'm a VP of Engineering. I love what I do and the team that I've built and I wouldn't trade it for the world.

These days, I do less on-the-job coding and I'm deeply focused on empowering my team to get stuff done and eliminate anything in their way. I'll offer guidance on trouble shooting, bug fixing, scaling, optimizing databases and writing less code to get more done. In order to scratch that development itch that I have, I contribute back to open source in any way that I can.

When I'm not hacking on things,  you can find me dabbling in photography, hiking/camping, or racing and wrenching on cars.
