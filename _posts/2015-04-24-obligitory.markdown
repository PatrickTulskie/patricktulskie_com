You know the feeling.  You're going through your fixed expenses and for the 5th year running, you wonder to yourself "Why am I still paying for this server to host my blog that I never update?"  Doing the rough math in your head, you realize you've just pissed away hundreds of dollars hosting a site that no one looks at, doesn't get updated, and even the existing content is of little to no value.  Then, you start thinking about all of those domains you've purchased because you have an idea...

But I digress.

Instead of curating content from the old blog and trying to somehow refactor it into a new structured format that works with Jekyll I decided to just throw it all in the trash.  Some of the posts might come back in one way or another.  It's hard to let go of things you've spent a lot of time creating.  I've spent countless hours writing these posts, talking about them with other people, having laughs and discussions over them but now it's time to say good bye.

Often times the best way to move forward is to just start over.

When I was skimming through my old posts, one thing I noticed is that they didn't really seem to have any rhyme or reason.  There was no flow or direction for the site as a whole.  While each post in and of itself might have had some value in that time, none of the stuff I wrote had any lasting value.  Going forward, that's going to have to change.  Posts are going to have to have _some_ sort of lasting value otherwise what is the point?

Time to sift through the past half decade and figure out what has some sort of meaning.
