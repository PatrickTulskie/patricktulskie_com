There once was a time where I cared about writing stuff down and sharing it with the world.  Maybe I just became too busy or maybe I ran out of things to say.  My old blog hadn't been updated in about 6 years and all this time I was just paying for hosting.  That's $720 spent on keeping a dead site alive.

What a fucking waste.

Recently Google has started emailing me to inform me that my version of Wordpress is really out of date and hackable.  I check the server from time to time and no one has logged in or made any changes to any files.  Maybe if someone had hacked it I'd have been motivated to do this long ago.

Earlier today, WebbyNode sent me an email to say that they were shutting down and I have to be out the door before the end of the month.  I've been experimenting with various technologies and ways to save money on this whole thing and now I'm kinda forced to take action.

So here is the new site.  It's not the first time I've uttered that phrase and it certainly won't be the last.

Maybe I'll brush the dust off some of the things I've written and never published.  Maybe.
